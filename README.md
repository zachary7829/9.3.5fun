# 9.3.5fun
gets root on iOS 9.0-9.3.6 32bit using Phoenix, and escapes sandbox

### Why?
~~I'm building this~~ stealing p0laris's code to attempt to learn more about how userland jailbreaks work

### Supported Devices
I'm testing this on an 9.3.5 iPad 2 but pretty much any 32bit device on 9.0-9.3.6 should work, including:
- iPad 2
- iPad 3
- iPad 4
- iPad Mini 1
- iPhone 4S
- iPhone 5
- iPhone 5C
- iPod Touch 5
- iPod Touch 6
